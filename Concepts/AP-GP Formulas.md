### Arithmetic Progression (AP)

1. **General Form**:  
   `a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ...`  
   - `a`: First term  
   - `d`: Common difference  

2. **nth Term of AP**:  
   `Tₙ = a + (n - 1) * d`

3. **Sum of First n Terms of AP**:  
   `Sₙ = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1) * d]`  
   Alternatively:  
   `Sₙ = n/2 * (a + l)`  
   - Where `l` is the last term.

### Geometric Progression (GP)

1. **General Form**:  
   `a, a * r, a * r², a * r³, ...`  
   - `a`: First term  
   - `r`: Common ratio  

2. **nth Term of GP**:  
   `Tₙ = a * r^(n-1)`

3. **Sum of First n Terms of GP**:  
   - If `r ≠ 1`:  
     `Sₙ = a * (1 - rⁿ) / (1 - r)`
   - If `r = 1`:  
     `Sₙ = n * a`

4. **Sum of Infinite GP** (when `|r| < 1`):  
   `S₀ = a / (1 - r)`

### Key Notes:
- AP is characterized by **addition** (common difference `d`).
- GP is characterized by **multiplication** (common ratio `r`).
- AP sums grow linearly, while GP sums grow exponentially if `|r| > 1`.
